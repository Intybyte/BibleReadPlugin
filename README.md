# Bible Read Plugin

A minecraft plugin for bukkit, paper and sponge that allows the player to read the bible. 
You can whole chapters in a book format (for all version) or using the new minecraft's dialog interface (paper only for now).

Support for 1000+ translations, all translations are courtesy of https://bible.helloao.org/docs/, where the translations, book and chapters are
downloaded from. Only the requested book & translations are downloaded and compressed to not occupy much space, they will be saved in the 
configuration folder together with some more information that is plugin specific.

The plugin's messages traslations for now are only available in en_us and it_it, if you want you can contribute more translations by opening a PR.

Commands, usage and permissions can be found in this repository [wiki section](https://github.com/Intybyte/BibleReadPlugin/wiki)

### Matthew 28:18-20 <br>
18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <br>
19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <br>
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” <br>
